scikit learn is a machine learning python package
which can be imported
it provides us some machine learning algorithms like
classification
regression
clustering
dimensionality reduction
model selection
preprocessing

classification is used to decide object belongs to which category
i.e. it is used when our data is needed to be classified
for ex- when data of face related to a cat is being sent, then the alogrithm
should classify it as cat

regression is done when we have to deal with constantly changing variable
for ex- weather forecast

clustering is used when we have been given a data and we need to automatically sort them in groups
we don't know which group, we just want to seperate similar data from the rest
for ex- asking 5 students a question and making different groups of them based on their answers
but in clustering we select the criteria of seperation which is know as similarity criteria

dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of dimenisons or variables which we are working on, 
which increases computation

model selection is used to compare, validate and choose parameters and models

preprocessing is used for feature extraction and normalization.
